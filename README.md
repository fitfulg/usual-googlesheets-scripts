Personal repo for my own customized "Google - Apps Scripts" code to enhance Google Sheets with additional formatting, validation, and chart creation capabilities.
The initial idea was just to practice the integration from this repo up to Google Apps Script via github actions but later I decided to also publish the small improvements that I am making in my custom template for the TODO sheet that I use on a daily basis.

# My own customized "Google Apps Script" code (v1.1.0)

Personal repo for my own customized "Google - Apps Scripts" code to enhance Google Sheets with additional formatting, validation, and chart creation capabilities.

The initial idea was just to practice the integration from this repo up to Google Apps Script via GitHub Actions, but later I decided to also publish the small improvements that I am making in my custom template for the TODO sheet that I use on a daily basis.

Apps Script uses Javascript and runs on Google Cloud.

## Quick Testing in Google Apps Script

To quickly test the code in Google Apps Script, you can copy the raw contents of the concatenated JavaScript file `concat-script.js` and paste it into the Apps Script editor. Follow these steps:

1. **Open the [concat-script.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fitfulg/usual-googlesheets-scripts/main/concat-script.js) file and copy its contents.**

2. **Open your Google Sheets document.**

3. **Go to Extensions > Apps Script.**

4. **Delete any existing code in the script editor.**

5. **Paste the contents of `concat-script.js` into the script editor.**

6. **Save the script and refresh your Google Sheets document.**
